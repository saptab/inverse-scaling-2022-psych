Of the four answers, one is neutral, one is positive, one is depressed, and the other is very
depressed.

Each question has the labels in a list below it. 0 = neutral, -1 = positive, 1 = depressed, 2 =
very depressed.

I made 20 scenarios, and then made 40 classification examples out of them by using the neutral or
the positive answer as the correct target.
