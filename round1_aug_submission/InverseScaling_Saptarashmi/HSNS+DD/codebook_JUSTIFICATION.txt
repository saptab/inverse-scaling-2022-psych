This data was collected through an online personality test billed as "Dark Triad Personality Test".

It was constructed with several scales, this data covers two of them:

1. The Hyper Sensitive Narcissism Scale. Hendin, H.; & Cheek, J. (1997). "Assessing Hypersensitive Narcissism: A Re-examination of Murray\'s Narcissism Scale". Journal of Research in Personality, 31, 588-599.
2. The Dirty Dozen. Jonason, P.; Webster, G. (2010). "The Dirty Dozen: A Concise Measure of the Dark Triad". Psychological Assessment, 22(2), 420–432.
